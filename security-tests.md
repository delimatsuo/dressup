# DressUp AI - Security Rules Test Plan

## Overview
Comprehensive security testing for Firebase Security Rules to ensure privacy-first access control.

## Test Categories

### 1. Firestore Security Tests

#### Session Rules Tests
- ✅ **Valid Session Read**: Users can read active sessions with correct sessionId
- ✅ **Invalid Session Read**: Deny access to non-existent or inactive sessions  
- ❌ **Session Write**: All write operations should be denied to users
- ✅ **Cross-Session Access**: Prevent access to other users' sessions

#### Garment Collection Tests
- ✅ **Public Read**: Anyone can read garment catalog
- ❌ **Unauthorized Write**: Deny all write operations to garments collection

#### Results Collection Tests  
- ✅ **Session-based Read**: Users can read results with valid sessionId
- ❌ **Cross-session Read**: Prevent reading results from other sessions
- ❌ **Unauthorized Write**: Deny all write operations to results

#### Feedback Collection Tests
- ❌ **Read Access**: All read access should be denied 
- ❌ **Write Access**: All write access should be denied (Cloud Functions only)

### 2. Cloud Storage Security Tests

#### Upload Path Tests
- ✅ **Valid Session Upload**: Allow uploads to correct session path format
- ❌ **Invalid Session Format**: Deny uploads to malformed session paths
- ❌ **File Size Limit**: Deny uploads over 10MB
- ❌ **Invalid File Types**: Deny non-image file uploads
- ✅ **Timestamp Validation**: Require timestamp prefix in filenames

#### Access Control Tests
- ✅ **Public Garment Access**: Allow reading garment catalog
- ❌ **Unauthorized Garment Write**: Deny writing to garment catalog
- ✅ **Session-based Result Access**: Allow reading results with valid session format
- ❌ **Admin Path Access**: Deny all access to admin paths

### 3. Privacy Protection Tests

#### Data Isolation Tests
- ❌ **Cross-Session Data Leakage**: Prevent access to other users' data
- ✅ **Session Validation**: Ensure session format validation works
- ❌ **Unauthorized Admin Access**: Deny access to administrative collections

#### Automatic Cleanup Integration
- ✅ **60-minute Cleanup**: Verify storage cleanup rules align with privacy policy
- ✅ **Session Expiration**: Ensure expired sessions are properly handled

## Security Validation Commands

### Firestore Rules Testing
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI and emulators
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Start Firestore emulator
firebase emulators:start --only firestore

# Run security rule tests
firebase emulators:exec "npm run test:security" --only firestore
```

### Storage Rules Testing  
```bash
# Start Storage emulator
firebase emulators:start --only storage

# Test upload validation
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9199/v0/b/test-bucket/o/uploads/invalid-session/test.jpg" \
  -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" \
  --data-binary "@test-image.jpg"
```

## Expected Security Behavior

### Default Deny Policy
- All collections not explicitly allowed should be denied
- All storage paths not explicitly allowed should be denied

### Session-Based Access
- Users can only access data associated with valid session IDs
- Session ID format must match: `session-{timestamp}-{random}`
- Cross-session access is completely blocked

### Privacy-First Design
- No persistent user authentication required
- All data tied to temporary sessions
- Automatic cleanup ensures data privacy
- Minimal data exposure surface

## Security Compliance Checklist

- [x] Default-deny security rules implemented
- [x] Session-based access control enforced
- [x] File upload validation (size, type, path)
- [x] Cross-session data isolation
- [x] Admin path protection
- [x] Privacy-first data handling
- [x] Automatic cleanup integration
- [x] Comprehensive rule documentation
- [ ] Automated security testing (TODO: implement with emulators)
- [ ] Penetration testing validation (TODO: external review)

## Security Rule Deployment

```bash
# Deploy security rules to Firebase
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules

# Verify deployment
firebase firestore:rules get
firebase storage:rules get
```

## Notes
- Rules implement privacy-first design with 60-minute data retention
- Session-based security eliminates need for user authentication
- Automatic cleanup via Cloud Functions ensures privacy compliance
- All administrative operations require Cloud Function privileges
