		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Migrate from Firebase to Vercel Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Firebase to Vercel migration into specific removal and replacement steps: removing Firebase dependencies, migrating storage solution, migrating authentication, updating configuration, and testing each component migration separately.",
			"reasoning": "This is a major infrastructure migration touching multiple critical systems (functions, storage, auth). Requires careful dependency management, configuration updates, and comprehensive testing. High risk of breaking changes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Next.js App Router API Routes",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create separate API routes for each service: session management endpoint, image upload endpoint, AI processing endpoint, plus cross-cutting concerns like error handling, request validation, rate limiting, and security headers.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving multiple API endpoints with different responsibilities. Requires understanding of Next.js App Router, Edge Runtime, and proper API design patterns. Security and performance considerations add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Gemini 2.5 Flash API with Enhanced Prompts",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into API integration, prompt engineering for different scenarios, error handling and retry logic, response processing, testing with mock data, and optimization for different garment types and poses.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to AI integration, prompt engineering requirements, and need for robust error handling. Requires understanding of Gemini API, prompt optimization, and handling of AI model variability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Vercel Blob Storage for Images",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into Vercel Blob configuration, file upload implementation, automatic cleanup mechanism, format validation and compression, and secure URL generation with expiration.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving file storage operations, automatic cleanup scheduling, and format handling. Requires understanding of Vercel Blob API and proper file management practices."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Session Management with Vercel KV",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into KV store configuration, session creation and tracking, TTL management and cleanup, and session restoration logic for page refreshes.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving Redis-like operations with TTL management. Well-established patterns exist for session management, but requires careful consideration of privacy and data lifecycle."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Update UI Components for Vercel Stack",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Update each major component separately: PhotoUploadInterface, ResultsDisplay, error handling components, plus removing Firebase imports and adding new API integration across all affected components.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving multiple React components and API integration changes. Requires maintaining existing functionality while replacing underlying services. Testing complexity due to UI changes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Multiple Pose Generation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into pose-specific prompt development, background generation logic, batch processing implementation, UI updates for multiple results, optimization for performance, and user experience flow design.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to advanced AI features, multiple pose variations, and batch processing requirements. Requires sophisticated prompt engineering and performance optimization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Add Image Quality Validation and Processing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate client-side validation, server-side preprocessing with Sharp, compression implementation, quality scoring algorithm, and error messaging for invalid images.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving both client and server-side processing. Requires understanding of image processing libraries, validation logic, and user experience for error states."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Performance and Mobile Experience",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into Next.js Image optimization, lazy loading implementation, mobile UI improvements, and bundle size optimization with code splitting.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity focused on optimization and mobile experience. Well-established patterns and tools available. Requires performance testing and mobile-specific considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy and Configure Production Environment",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into Vercel deployment configuration, environment variables setup, monitoring and error tracking, security headers and CSP, automated deployment setup, and production testing validation.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to production deployment requirements, security considerations, and monitoring setup. Critical task that affects all other components and requires comprehensive testing."
