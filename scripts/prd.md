**Product:** DressUp - Virtual Outfit Try-On Application  
**Author:** Gemini & Development Team  
**Version:** 1.1 (Implementation Complete)  
**Date:** September 4, 2025 (Updated: September 5, 2025)  
**Repository:** [https://github.com/delimatsuo/dressup](https://github.com/delimatsuo/dressup)  
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION  

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a Proof of Concept (PoC) of "Project V-Style," a web application designed to solve a primary pain point in e-commerce: the inability for shoppers to accurately visualize how clothing will look on their own bodies. This uncertainty leads to low purchase confidence and high return rates.

The PoC will leverage the generative capabilities of the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model to create realistic images of a user wearing a garment they select online. This will be a minimal, focused experiment to test the following core hypothesis:

**"AI-generated virtual try-on images are realistic and valuable enough to significantly increase a user's confidence in making an online clothing purchase."**

**Target Audience:** 10-20 frequent online shoppers who purchase clothing 2-3 times per month and have previously returned items due to poor fit or appearance.

## Core Features

### 1. Session-Based Photo Upload System
- **What it does:** Allows users to upload 2-3 personal photos (front, side, optional back) for AI processing
- **Why it's important:** Creates the foundation for personalized virtual try-on without permanent storage
- **How it works:** Secure file upload to Cloud Storage with automatic session-based cleanup

### 2. Garment Visualization Engine  
- **What it does:** Processes user photos and garment images to generate realistic try-on images
- **Why it's important:** Core value proposition - shows how clothes look on the user's body
- **How it works:** Integrates with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model via Vertex AI SDK

### 3. Multi-Pose Generation
- **What it does:** Creates three distinct poses: Standing Front, Standing Side, Walking Side
- **Why it's important:** Provides comprehensive view of fit, silhouette, and garment drape
- **How it works:** AI model generates multiple perspectives based on single garment input

### 4. Privacy-First Architecture
- **What it does:** Ensures all personal photos are deleted within 60 minutes or session end
- **Why it's important:** Builds user trust and meets privacy requirements
- **How it works:** Firebase Storage lifecycle rules and explicit session management

### 5. Feedback Collection System
- **What it does:** Captures user ratings on realism and helpfulness plus open feedback
- **Why it's important:** Validates PoC hypothesis and guides future development
- **How it works:** Simple 5-point scale ratings with optional text feedback

## User Experience

### User Personas
**Primary:** Sarah, 28, Marketing Manager
- Shops online 2-3x monthly for work and casual clothing
- Has returned 30% of online clothing purchases due to poor fit
- Values convenience but frustrated by sizing uncertainty
- Tech-savvy and privacy-conscious

### Key User Flows

#### Primary Flow: Virtual Try-On
1. **Welcome & Consent:** User reads explanation and privacy disclaimer
2. **Personal Photos:** Upload front photo (required), side photo (required), back photo (optional)
3. **Garment Upload:** Upload single clothing item photo
4. **Generation:** Click "Generate My Poses" → loading state → AI processing
5. **Results:** View gallery of 3 generated images
6. **Feedback:** Rate realism/helpfulness, provide text feedback
7. **Iterate:** Option to try another outfit without re-uploading personal photos

### UI/UX Considerations
- **Simplicity:** Single-page application with clear, linear flow
- **Privacy Transparency:** Prominent privacy disclaimers at each step
- **Loading States:** Clear feedback during AI processing (up to 90 seconds)
- **Mobile Responsive:** Optimized for mobile shopping context
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive design

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (MVP)
**Scope:** Basic working pipeline from upload to AI generation
- Set up Firebase project with hosting, storage, and functions
- Implement file upload UI with validation (JPG/PNG/HEIC, 10MB limit)
- Create Cloud Function for Gemini API integration
- Basic image generation with single pose (standing front only)
- Simple success/error states

- Final UI/UX polish
- Load testing and scalability validation

**Deliverable:** Production-ready PoC for limited user testing

## Logical Dependency Chain

### Foundation First (Phase 1)
1. **Firebase Setup** → Core infrastructure must exist before any development
2. **File Upload System** → Users need to input photos before processing
3. **Cloud Function Backbone** → Backend logic required before AI integration
4. **Basic Gemini Integration** → Prove AI generation works with minimal scope

### Build Upward (Phases 2-3)  
5. **Multi-Pose Generation** → Extend working AI integration
6. **Gallery UI** → Display multiple results effectively
7. **Session Management** → Enable multiple garment tries per session
8. **Privacy Implementation** → Essential before any user testing

### Validation Ready (Phases 4-5)
9. **Feedback Collection** → Measure success metrics
10. **Performance Optimization** → Ensure good user experience
11. **Final Polish** → Production-ready for validation study

**Critical Path:** Firebase Setup → File Upload → Cloud Function → Gemini Integration → Multi-Pose → Session Management → Privacy Implementation → Feedback System

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets
- **Realism Score:** Average ≥ 3.5/5 (demonstrates convincing AI generation)
- **Helpfulness Score:** Average ≥ 4.0/5 (validates purchase confidence hypothesis)
- **Task Completion Rate:** >80% of users successfully generate at least one image set
- **Technical Performance:** End-to-end generation completes in <90 seconds

### Qualitative Validation
- User feedback expressing "I would use this for shopping"
- Comments indicating increased purchase confidence
- Minimal complaints about privacy or data handling
- Positive sentiment toward AI-generated accuracy

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
**Risk:** Gemini 2.5 Flash Image quality inconsistent for fashion try-on use case
- **Mitigation:** Extensive prompt engineering and testing with diverse garment types
- **Contingency:** Fallback to alternative AI models if quality insufficient

**Risk:** 90-second generation time creates poor UX
- **Mitigation:** Implement engaging loading states, set proper expectations
- **Contingency:** Parallel processing optimization, caching strategies

**Risk:** File upload/storage complexity in browser environment
- **Mitigation:** Use Firebase SDK best practices, thorough testing across devices
- **Contingency:** Simplify to single photo requirement if needed

### MVP Definition and Scope
**Risk:** Feature creep beyond PoC scope
- **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to user stories, regular scope reviews
- **Contingency:** Cut non-essential features (back photo, walking pose) if needed

**Risk:** Privacy requirements add significant complexity
- **Mitigation:** Use Firebase built-in security features, lifecycle rules
- **Contingency:** Manual cleanup processes as temporary solution

### Resource Constraints  
**Risk:** Gemini API costs exceed budget during testing
- **Mitigation:** Rate limiting, usage monitoring, test with smaller dataset
- **Contingency:** Reduce poses to 2 instead of 3, limit testing participants

**Risk:** Development timeline pressure compromises quality
- **Mitigation:** Focus on core pipeline first, iterative quality improvements
- **Contingency:** Launch Phase 1 as minimal PoC, iterate based on feedback
