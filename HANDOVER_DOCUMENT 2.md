# DressUp AI Virtual Try-On Application - Technical Handover Document

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Status**: Application is DOWN - "Error: internal" displayed on frontend
**Root Cause**: Firebase Functions deployment failure - functions are deleted but new ones haven't been deployed
**User's Last Action**: Deleted all Firebase functions via Firebase Console

## Current Situation Summary

The DressUp AI virtual try-on application is experiencing a complete service outage. The frontend at https://dressup-nine.vercel.app is running but cannot create sessions due to Firebase Functions being offline. The main issue is that the Firebase Functions have been deleted from the console but the new corrected versions cannot be deployed due to timeout issues.

## Project Overview

- **Application**: DressUp AI - Virtual outfit try-on using AI
- **Frontend URL**: https://dressup-nine.vercel.app
- **Backend**: Firebase Functions (currently DOWN)
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview
- **Project ID**: projectdressup
- **Region**: us-central1

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.2, React 19.1.0, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Firebase Functions v6.2.0, Node.js 20
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **AI Integration**: @google/generative-ai (Gemini API)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Firebase (backend)

## Critical Files and Their Current State

### 1. Firebase Functions (Backend) - `/functions/`

#### Core Issue Files:
- **`/functions/src/index.ts`** - Main entry point, exports all Cloud Functions
- **`/functions/src/sessionFunctions.ts`** - Session management (FIXED locally, not deployed)
- **`/functions/src/imageGeneration.ts`** - AI image generation with simplified prompt (FIXED locally)
- **`/functions/src/storageCleanup.ts`** - Storage cleanup functions
- **`/functions/lib/*.js`** - Compiled JavaScript files (READY but not deployed)

#### Key Changes Made:
1. Simplified AI prompt to: "The user in image number one would like to see themselves wearing the garment in image number two. Make a photorealistic image of the user wearing the garment in a background that matches the style of the garment."
2. Fixed sessionFunctions.ts to export regular functions instead of Firebase v2 onCall functions
3. Removed Vertex AI dependencies (using @google/generative-ai instead)
4. Fixed Firebase Functions v6 compatibility issues (removed runWith, schedule methods)

### 2. Frontend Components - `/src/`

#### Working Components:
- **`/src/components/MobilePhotoUpload.tsx`** - Fixed to upload to Firebase Storage (not base64)
- **`/src/components/GarmentUpload.tsx`** - Fixed sessionId extraction
- **`/src/components/PhotoUploadInterface.tsx`** - Main upload interface
- **`/src/components/ResultsDisplay.tsx`** - Shows generated images

### 3. Configuration Files

- **`/functions/package.json`** - Has all dependencies
- **`/firebase.json`** - Firebase configuration
- **`.env.local`** - Contains API keys (not in repo)
- **`/.firebaserc`** - Has JSON error but works

## Deployment Issues & Solutions

### Current Blocking Issue:
Firebase deployment times out repeatedly when running:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions --force
```

### What's Been Tried:
1. ✅ Deleted all old functions via Firebase Console
2. ✅ Fixed TypeScript source files
3. ✅ Compiled to JavaScript (lib directory exists)
4. ❌ Firebase deploy command times out after 2 minutes
5. ❌ Background deployment attempts also timeout
6. ❌ Specific function deployment times out

### Immediate Fix Options:

#### Option 1: Manual Firebase Console Deployment
Since CLI deployment fails, try:
1. Create a ZIP of the functions folder
2. Upload directly via Google Cloud Console
3. Or use Google Cloud Build triggers

#### Option 2: Use gcloud CLI
```bash
cd /Users/delimatsuo/Documents/Coding/dressup/functions
gcloud functions deploy createUserSession \
  --runtime nodejs20 \
  --trigger-http \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --source . \
  --entry-point createUserSession \
  --region us-central1
```

#### Option 3: Fix Firebase CLI Timeout
The issue might be with:
- Corrupted `.firebaserc` (shows JSON error)
- Network/proxy issues
- Firebase CLI version
- Node modules corruption in functions folder

## Functions That Need Deployment

These are the corrected functions that need to be deployed:

1. **createUserSession** - Creates new user sessions
2. **validateUserSession** - Validates existing sessions  
3. **extendUserSession** - Extends session expiry
4. **deleteSession** - Deletes user sessions
5. **generateTryOn** - Generates single try-on image
6. **generateMultipleTryOnPoses** - Generates multiple poses
7. **manualCleanup** - Manual cleanup trigger

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in Firebase Functions config:
```bash
firebase functions:config:set google_ai.api_key="YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY"
```

Or set in environment:
- `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` - For Gemini API access

## Known Issues & Context

### 1. AI Image Generation Problem (Partially Solved)
- **Original Issue**: AI was generating different people instead of preserving user identity
- **User Complaint**: "The person is not the user" in generated images
- **Solution Applied**: Simplified prompt to be more direct
- **Status**: Code updated but not tested due to deployment failure

### 2. Session Creation Failure
- **Issue**: Frontend shows "Error: internal" when loading
- **Cause**: createUserSession function returns 500 error
- **Root Cause**: Functions are using wrong export format (onCall vs regular functions)
- **Fix**: Already fixed in code, needs deployment

### 3. TypeScript Compilation Issues
- **Issue**: Various TypeScript errors during build
- **Workaround**: Using `--skipLibCheck` flag
- **Long-term Fix**: Update type definitions and fix imports

## Testing Endpoints

Once deployed, test with:
```bash
# Test session creation
curl -X POST https://us-central1-projectdressup.cloudfunctions.net/createUserSession \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# Should return:
# {"success":true,"sessionId":"uuid-here","expiresIn":3600}
```

## Development Environment

### Local Development Setup:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Frontend
cd /Users/delimatsuo/Documents/Coding/dressup
npm run dev
# Running on http://localhost:3001

# Terminal 2 - Functions
cd functions
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Active Background Processes:
- Dev server running on port 3001 (PID in background)
- Port 3000 is occupied by another process (PID 92678)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Deploy functions using alternative method (gcloud or Cloud Console)
2. **TEST**: Verify session creation works
3. **TEST**: Upload test images and verify AI generation with new prompt
4. **MONITOR**: Check Firebase logs for any errors
5. **FIX**: Resolve .firebaserc JSON error
6. **OPTIMIZE**: Consider migrating to Firebase Functions v2 HTTP triggers

## Important Code Context

### Session Functions Export Issue (FIXED in lib/sessionFunctions.js)
```javascript
// OLD (Firebase v2 onCall - doesn't work with index.js)
export const createSession = onCall({}, async (request) => {...})

// NEW (Regular async function - works with index.js)
export async function createSession() {...}
```

### Simplified AI Prompt (FIXED in lib/imageGeneration.js)
```javascript
const basePrompt = `The user in image number one would like to see themselves wearing the garment in image number two. Make a photorealistic image of the user wearing the garment in a background that matches the style of the garment.`;
```

## Contact & Resources

- **Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/projectdressup
- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com (check for frontend deployments)
- **Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/functions?project=projectdressup
- **GitHub Issues**: Report any Firebase CLI issues

## Final Notes

The application is architecturally sound and the code fixes are complete. The only blocking issue is the Firebase deployment timeout. Once the functions are successfully deployed using any alternative method, the application should work correctly with the simplified AI prompt that better preserves user identity in generated images.

The user specifically requested the prompt be simplified to better maintain their identity in the generated outfit images. This has been implemented but needs deployment to test.
