# DressUp AI - Project Status Report

## Current Status: FAILING

The virtual try-on application is **NOT WORKING** despite multiple deployment attempts.

## What IS Working ✅

### Frontend Application
- ✅ Next.js 15.5.2 application runs at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ User can upload photos (both user and garment images)
- ✅ UI displays uploaded images correctly
- ✅ File upload to Firebase Storage works
- ✅ Session management works
- ✅ Professional UI design with proper styling
- ✅ Multi-step upload process works
- ✅ CORS configuration for Firebase Storage is correct

### Backend Infrastructure
- ✅ Firebase Cloud Functions deployed successfully
- ✅ Cloud Function has proper authentication (unauthenticated access enabled)
- ✅ Google AI API key is configured in Firebase secrets
- ✅ All required packages installed (@google/generative-ai)
- ✅ Firebase project configuration is correct

## What IS NOT Working ❌

### Core Functionality - Virtual Try-On
- ❌ **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Virtual try-on image generation completely broken
- ❌ Cloud Function crashes with 500 Internal Server Error
- ❌ No AI-generated images are produced
- ❌ Application shows "Error: Failed to process image" every time

### Technical Issues Identified
1. **API Integration Problems**: Despite using the correct Google AI SDK and model (`gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`), the integration fails
2. **Field Name Conflicts**: Confusion between `inlineData` (TypeScript interface) vs `inline_data` (API expectation)
3. **Response Parsing Issues**: Unable to correctly extract generated images from Gemini API responses
4. **Error Handling**: Errors are not properly surfaced to help debug the root cause

## Latest Error (from console logs)
```
Error processing multi-photo outfit: FirebaseError: Failed to process image
```

## Attempts Made (All Failed)
1. ❌ Initially used Vertex AI SDK (wrong approach)
2. ❌ Switched to Google AI SDK with correct model
3. ❌ Fixed API key configuration 
4. ❌ Corrected field name issues (inlineData vs inline_data)
5. ❌ Multiple deployment cycles with different configurations

## Root Cause Analysis
The fundamental issue appears to be with the Gemini API integration. Despite following the documentation and using the correct:
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`
- API Key: Valid and configured
- SDK: `@google/generative-ai`
- Request format: Following documentation examples

The API calls are still failing, suggesting either:
1. Model availability issues
2. API quota/permission problems  
3. Incorrect request format despite following docs
4. Gemini image generation model limitations

## Current State for New Developer
- **Codebase**: Clean, well-structured, ready for debugging
- **Infrastructure**: Fully set up and deployed
- **Configuration**: All secrets and environment variables configured
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs created for Gemini integration

## Recommended Next Steps for New Developer
1. **Debug Cloud Function logs** - Check actual error messages from Gemini API
2. **Test Gemini API directly** - Verify image generation works outside the application
3. **Consider alternative models** - May need to use Imagen or different approach
4. **Implement better error reporting** - Surface actual API errors to frontend

## Files to Review
- `/functions/src/imageGeneration.ts` - Core generation logic
- `/functions/src/index.ts` - Main Cloud Function
- `/docs/GEMINI_IMAGE_GENERATION.md` - API documentation
- `/src/lib/firebase.ts` - Frontend integration

## Timeline
- **Started**: Multiple days of development
- **Current Status**: Complete failure of core functionality
- **User Expectation**: Working virtual try-on with restaurant backgrounds and happy expressions
- **Reality**: Basic image upload only, no AI generation

The application is essentially a photo upload tool that doesn't deliver on its primary promise of virtual try-on functionality.
