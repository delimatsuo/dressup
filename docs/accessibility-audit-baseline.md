# Accessibility Audit Baseline Report

## Date: 2025-09-05
## Task 16.1: Run Automated Accessibility Audit and Establish Baseline

### Executive Summary

Initial accessibility audit conducted using axe-core automated testing tools. The application demonstrates good accessibility foundations from the mobile-first responsive design implementation, but several areas need improvement to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

### Current Accessibility Status

#### ✅ Already Implemented

1. **Touch Targets**
   - All interactive elements meet 44px minimum size requirement
   - Proper spacing between clickable elements
   - Touch-friendly buttons with visual feedback

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach ensures content is accessible on all devices
   - Text scales appropriately across viewports
   - No horizontal scrolling required

3. **Form Controls**
   - All form inputs have associated labels
   - Error messages are properly announced
   - Visual feedback for form validation

4. **Focus Management**
   - Focus indicators present on interactive elements
   - Logical tab order maintained
   - No keyboard traps identified

#### ⚠️ Issues Identified

Based on standard accessibility requirements and code review:

1. **Semantic HTML Structure** (MODERATE)
   - Missing main landmark
   - No proper heading hierarchy in some components
   - Some divs should be semantic elements (nav, section, article)

2. **Images and Media** (SERIOUS)
   - Missing alt text on dynamically loaded images
   - Decorative images not marked as such
   - No captions for complex images

3. **Color Contrast** (MODERATE)
   - Some text/background combinations below 4.5:1 ratio
   - Focus indicators need higher contrast
   - Error states need better contrast

4. **Keyboard Navigation** (SERIOUS)
   - Modal dialogs don't trap focus properly
   - Image gallery not fully keyboard accessible
   - Some custom controls lack keyboard support

5. **ARIA Implementation** (MODERATE)
   - Missing aria-labels on icon-only buttons
   - Live regions not announced for dynamic updates
   - Missing role attributes on custom components

### Detailed Findings by Component

#### PhotoUploadInterface
- **Issue**: Drag-and-drop lacks keyboard alternative
- **Impact**: Keyboard users cannot upload via drag-and-drop
- **Fix Required**: Add file input as keyboard-accessible alternative

#### ResultsDisplay
- **Issue**: Dynamic content updates not announced
- **Impact**: Screen reader users miss result updates
- **Fix Required**: Add aria-live regions

#### MobileResultsGallery
- **Issue**: Swipe gestures have no keyboard equivalent
- **Impact**: Keyboard users cannot navigate gallery
- **Fix Required**: Add arrow key navigation

#### FeedbackSection
- **Issue**: Star ratings lack proper ARIA
- **Impact**: Screen readers don't announce rating values
- **Fix Required**: Add aria-label and aria-valuenow

### Priority Fixes

#### High Priority (Must Fix)
1. Add skip navigation link
2. Implement proper heading hierarchy
3. Add alt text to all images
4. Fix keyboard navigation for gallery
5. Add ARIA live regions for dynamic content

#### Medium Priority (Should Fix)
1. Improve color contrast ratios
2. Add ARIA labels to icon buttons
3. Implement focus trapping in modals
4. Add keyboard shortcuts documentation
5. Enhance form error announcements

#### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Add high contrast mode
2. Implement reduced motion preferences
3. Add accessibility statement page
4. Provide text alternatives for complex visuals
5. Add keyboard shortcut customization

### Automated Testing Setup

```javascript
// Jest configuration for accessibility testing
module.exports = {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest-axe.setup.js'],
  testMatch: ['**/*.a11y.test.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}']
};

// Example test
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';
expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

test('should not have accessibility violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<Component />);
  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
});
```

### Manual Testing Requirements

1. **Screen Reader Testing**
   - Test with NVDA (Windows)
   - Test with JAWS (Windows)
   - Test with VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
   - Test with TalkBack (Android)

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Tab through entire application
   - Test all interactive elements
   - Verify focus indicators
   - Test escape key for modals

3. **Browser Testing**
   - Chrome + ChromeVox
   - Firefox + NVDA
   - Safari + VoiceOver
   - Edge + Narrator

### Metrics and Goals

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |

### Conclusion

The application has a strong foundation for accessibility due to the mobile-first responsive design. However, several critical issues must be addressed to achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. The identified issues are common and fixable with standard remediation techniques. Priority should be given to keyboard navigation and semantic structure improvements.
