- Screen reader navigation landmarks

**ARIA Landmarks (23 landmarks):**
- `main` - Primary content areas
- `region` - Distinct sections with proper labeling
- `group` - Related form controls and actions
- `tablist/tab` - Gallery navigation

#### Focus Management

**Focus Trap Implementation:**
- Modal dialogs properly trap focus
- Gallery fullscreen mode focus management
- Form navigation with proper tab order
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
