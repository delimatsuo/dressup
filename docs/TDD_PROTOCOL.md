# TDD Protocol (Project-wide)

- Always write tests first (unit and integration when feasible).
- Implement the minimum code necessary to make tests pass.
- Update documentation after tests pass.
- Commit changes with clear messages and push to remote.
- Proceed immediately to the next task without waiting for approval.
- Log implementation notes in Task Master for each subtask when possible.

This protocol applies to every task and subtask in this project.
